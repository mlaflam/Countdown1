    <h3>Pets and Plants</h3>
    <p>
        I have a dog named Atticus thats a Shi-poo. 
        He's not named after Finch from TKAM but after a detective from one of my mom's favorite shows.
        He is the cutest dog in the world and no one can convince me otherwise!

    <p>I am also a proud plant mom of over 50 plants! It's been a lot harder to keep them alive during college though...</p>
