                I have a dog named Atticus thats a Shi-poo.
                He's not named after Finch from TKAM but after a detective from one of my mom's favorite shows.
                He is the cutest dog in the world and no one can convince me otherwise!

                I am also a proud plant mom of over 50 plants! It's been a lot harder to keep them alive during
                college though...
